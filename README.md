# Business Model Canvas for Vim

Enjoy iterating your kick-ass business model with your favorite text editor.

> This is my first (usefull) public repository on github. Feedback is much appreciated.

## Description

Translation of the Business Model Canvas of [strategyzer.com] into a vim
session, ready for crunch time. The session file ``bmc.vim`` tiles vim into the
well-known grid of the Business Model Canvas. Each split contains a file
corresponding to an element of your model.

# Business Model Canvas for Vim

Enjoy iterating your kickass business model in your favorite text editor.

> This is my first (usefull) public repository on github. Feedback is much appreciated.

## Description

Translation of the [*Business Model Canvas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas) from 
[Strategyzer](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas)
into a ``vim session``, ready for crunch time. Starting ``vim`` with the session
``bmc.vim`` tiles the editor into the well-known layout of the *Business Model
Canvas*. Each tile contains a file corresponding to an element of the model. 
The files grouped under the same directory belong to the same model.
